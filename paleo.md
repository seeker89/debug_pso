## Autoimmune Paleo Protocol

At this stage, using the [Pagano diet](README.md) I was able to get about 1/3 of the way to a healthy looking skin.

Unlike all the steroids, creams and ointments, it was the first thing that really helped me keep it under control.
It's clearly a step in the right direction, but it doesn't yield the results quickly enough for me to stay motivated.

That's why I'm going to conduct a 6-weeks experiment with the Paleo.

## The guide

### Don't have

- nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, sweet and hot peppers, cayenne, red pepper, tomatillos, goji berries etc. and spices derived from peppers, including paprika)
- grains (cereals, etc)
- seeds (including cocoa, coffee and seed-based spices)
- nuts
- legumes (beans, peas, lentils)
- dairy (apart from kefir)
- refined sugars
- modern vegetable oils (olive oil is fine)
- processed food chemicals
- gluten
- eggs (especially the whites)
- fructose consumption in excess of 20g per day
- alcohol
- NSAIDS (ibuprofen)
- non-nutritive sweeteners
- emulsifiers, thickeners, and other food additives


### Have

- fish and shellfish (wild is best, but farmed is fine) (>= 3/week)
- vegetables, as much variety as possible and the whole rainbow, aim for 8-14 cups per day
  - green vegetables
  - colorful vegetables and fruit (red, purple, blue, yellow, orange, white)
  - cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, turnips, arugula, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, watercress, mustard greens, etc.)
  - sea vegetables (excluding algae like chlorella and spirulina which are immune stimulators)
- quality meats (grass-fed, pasture-raised, wild as much as possible) (poultry in moderation due to high omega-6 content unless you are eating a ton of fish)
- quality fats (fatty fish, olive, avocado, coconut, palm [not palm kernel], pasture-raised/grass-fed animal fats [rendered or as part of your meat])
- fruit (keeping fructose intake between 10g and 20 g daily)
- probiotic foods (fermented vegetables or fruit, kombucha, water kefir, coconut milk kefir, coconut milk yogurt, supplements)â€“read about them here and here.
- glycine-rich foods (anything with connective tissue, joints or skin, organ meat, and __bone broth__)
- organ meat and offal (aim for 5 times per week, the more the better)


### Reintroduce

Once the autoimmune reaction is gone, food can be reintroduced, one at a time.
