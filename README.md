# Debugging psoriasis

Write up of the natural ways of dealing with psoriasis.

Inspired by "healing psoriasis - the natural alternative" by John O. A. Pagano, and different materials found on the internet.

```
Psoriasis is the external manifestation of the body's attempt to "throw off" internal toxins (...) the skin is doing what the bowels and kidneys should be doing.
```


## The approach


## Eating


## Supplements
