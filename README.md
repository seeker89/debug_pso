# Debugging psoriasis

Write up of the natural ways of dealing with psoriasis.

Inspired by "healing psoriasis - the natural alternative" by John O. A. Pagano, and different materials found on the internet.

Psoriasis is the external manifestation of the body's attempt to "throw off" internal toxins 
(...) the skin is doing what the bowels and kidneys should be doing.
